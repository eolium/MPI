PB : How could we use sportwashing to influence the event ?

I - Boycott all merchandising around the event
	- clothes and sport equipments
	- tickets to the event

II - Boycott the way of viewing (and paying) the event
	- set up unofficial (and naturaly illegal) ways to watch the event
	- distribute these ways to all the places of viewing the event.
