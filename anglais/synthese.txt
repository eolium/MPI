- director of Euro 2024 in Qatar

- all football communities love this sport, but set up the W-C in Qatar was a mistake,
	- Human rights were and are not respected.
		- Some good decisions were made, but gay people and women are still discriminated
		- Work Exploitation have been used to build all the infrastructure in short time
			-> Qatar has hadmitted abused, but families weren't compensated


	- statdiums build are now unused
		-> These infrastructures could be used elsewhere
		-> Because of discriminations, girls pratically cannot play football professionnally


- But relativism (bah oui bien sÃ»r)

	- Football community have help to developp the country in other competitions

	- Qatar is an economical and energetical partner of occident countries
		-> so good relations have to be maintained (abadakor)


- Author explains he will see event, because :
	- W-C is good in principle
	- there is a different, teams had no time for preparations
	- this event would maybe helps to open minds, and favorise a better spirit, with solidarity and resilience.
